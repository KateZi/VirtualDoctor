# Virtual Doctor

This project was developed as a demo for a potential application aimed at enhancing patient monitoring. 
The core idea is to utilize commmonly available resources, namely smartphones, to leverage patient monitoring and imrpove symptoms and treatment management.

The main point of interaction is voice as it provides ease of use for patients with various disorders, while encoding a multitude of information. 
Dialogue in audio and the transcribed forms are available for each session, as well as touch and sensor recordings.

HeyGen is used for the doctor agent imitation and OpenAI is used for speech recognition. The project is developed with Android and iOS in mind.
Further features could include:
* HeyGen API integration
* OpenAI chat integraation
* Calendar integration
* Symptoms dynamics presentation, e.g. voice changes and or drag&drop features changes

This project showcases potential uses of commonly available software and GenAI in the medical field. 
On a personal level, this project served as an entry point into Typescript, React Native and Expo development.
